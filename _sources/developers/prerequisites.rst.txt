Prerequisites
=============

``nodeJS``

  This template is tested against ``modejs`` version 22.14.0.

``pnpm``

  The package manager of choice. (See :ref:`replace pnpm` if you object to efficiency.)

``docker``

  (And ``docker compose``---commonly bundled when you install Docker.)

  * ``docker`` version v28+
  * ``docker compose`` version v2.33+

``git``

  Pretty much any modern ``git``, at the time of writing I have v2.39.5 installed.
