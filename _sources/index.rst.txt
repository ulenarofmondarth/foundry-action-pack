Action Pack (v2)
================

This module is a fork of the original `Action Pack <https://foundryvtt.com/packages/action-pack>`_ updated for Foundry V13 using the new UI.

The idea of this module is to allow quick access to all the activatable items on the character sheet. This will in most cases remove the need to have the character sheet open all the time. The list is also intended to provide a quick overview of everything, not requiring flipping tabs on the sheet itself.
