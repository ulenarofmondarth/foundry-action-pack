With apologies to all those I missed, here is a list of projects, organisations, and individuals to whom I owe a debt.

For the original version of this module:

* `Tero Parvinen <https://github.com/teroparvinen>`_

For the myriad technology that this development environment uses:

* javascript
* typescript
* vite
* vitest
* svelte
* pnpm
* nodejs
* docker
* husky
* eslint
* lint-staged
* commitizen

Too many package development teams/individuals to mention them all individually, but here are a couple:

* `MrVauxs <https://github.com/MrVauxs>`_ for `FoundrytVTT-Sync <https://github.com/MrVauxs/FoundryVTT-Sync>`_.
